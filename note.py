# requirments:-

# 1)python has garbage collector(gc method)
# 2)python is a general purpuse ,object orinted,high level language
# 3)object is a real world intity
# 4)it is based on dynamic typing
# 5)it is based on strong typing


# # token->its small units of our program .which has some meaning for  transform 
# example-> print("welcome"); 3 token

# types->1)keylwords,2)identifier,3)literals,4)special symbol,5)operators
# keyword->keword is reserved word
# note-> 3 kewords are capitalizeed. True,False,None
# identifier->
# rules->1)first character must be in alphabet+underscore
# 2)remaining->alphabet+ underscore+digit
# 3)no keyword is allowed
# 4)no whitespace
# 5)name should be relavent

# literals->thisare objects stored in mrmory to perform operation
# example-> fruit="mango" #string literals
#  n=90 # int literals

# special symbol->[],{},:,'',;,


# operator->when ever we wqant to perform any operation then we have to use some operator

# note->modulas operator is used in cyclic procces


# floore division operator->

# implace->implace function are the function in which no exta object has been created
# count->how many repeated number in the list
# special note->
# no return function->append(),extend(), sort(), reverse(), insert(), clear()
# return function->count(), index(), len(), max(), min(), sum(), pop()


# slice->sliceing is used to get the slice of sequnce data type
